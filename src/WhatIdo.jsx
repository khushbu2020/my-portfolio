      In addition to my core skills in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React.js, Redux, and Tailwind CSS, I excel in version control with Git, enabling efficient collaboration and code management. My expertise lies in crafting responsive and visually appealing interfaces using these technologies. With a strong foundation in JavaScript, I leverage frameworks like React.js and state management with Redux to build dynamic and scalable web applications. I also have a deep understanding of CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and utility-first frameworks like Tailwind CSS, ensuring efficient and maintainable styling solutions.
